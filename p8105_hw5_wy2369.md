# Problem 1

# Problem 2

### Read and clean

Using the code chunk to read and clean data from `homicide-data.csv`

``` r
homicide_data = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Describe the raw data

In the raw data, there are **52179** rows and **12** columns. It
contains **12** important variables which are uid (`uid`), dates of
report (`reported_date`), last and first names of victim
(`victim_last`and `victim_first`), race of victim (`victim_race`), age
of victim (`victim_age`), sex of victim (`victim_sex`), variables of
location (`city`, `state`, `lat` and `lon` ), and the status of case
(`disposition`) from 50 large cities in the U.S.

### Create a city_state variable

(e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the
total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those
for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No
arrest”).
